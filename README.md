I made this tool based on my python studies.
It downloads videos and audios from youtube. 
Just choose the format, and add the link.

## Installation

# First download python in your termux
$ pkg install python

# Install pytube, using pip
$ pip install pytube

# Then install git in termux
$ pkg install git

# Copy the repository address link and run the following command
$ git clone https://github.com/yHaper/yTube
```

## Usage

```
# Go to the repository folder using the following command
$ cd yTube

# Finally, run the script with the following command
$ python yTube.py
```
